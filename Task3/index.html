            Umm Qais is a Jordanian town located in the Bani Kinanah
            District of the Irbid Governorate in the north of the Kingdom.
            Situated 28 km north of Irbid at an altitude of 364 meters,
            it overlooks the Yarmouk River, the Golan Heights,
            and the Sea of Galilee. Its strategic location,
            coupled with its abundant water supply,
            attracted significant population growth.
            Its ancient name was Gadara, meaning "fortifications" or "fortified city."
            Among its most important archaeological remains are the
            western amphitheater, the colonnaded street,
            and the decorated tomb church.
            The name of Gadara University is derived from this location.
